### Field Description

C/A,UNIT,SCP,STATION,LINENAME,DIVISION,DATE,TIME,DESC,ENTRIES,EXITS


C/A      = Control Area (A002)<br />
UNIT     = Remote Unit for a station (R051)<br />
SCP      = Subunit Channel Position represents an specific address for a device (02-00-00)<br />
STATION  = Represents the station name the device is located at.<br /> 
LINENAME = Represents all train lines that can be boarded at this station
           Normally lines are represented by one character.  LINENAME 456NQR repersents train server for 4, 5, 6, N, Q, and R trains.<br />
DIVISION = Represents the Line originally the station belonged to BMT, IRT, or IND.<br />     
DATE     = Represents the date (MM-DD-YY).<br />
TIME     = Represents the time (hh:mm:ss) for a scheduled audit event.<br />
DESc     = Represent the "REGULAR" scheduled audit event (Normally occurs every 4 hours).<br /> 
           1. Audits may occur more that 4 hours due to planning, or troubleshooting activities.<br />   
           2. Additionally, there may be a "RECOVR AUD" entry: This refers to a missed audit that was recovered.<br />   
ENTRIES  = The comulative entry register value for a device.<br /> 
EXIST    = The cumulative exit register value for a device.<br /> 



Example:
The data below shows the entry/exit register values for one turnstile at control area (A002) from 09/27/14 at 00:00 hours to 09/29/14 at 00:00 hours<br />
